## Idea
There is an overwhelming amount of information in the world constantly being presented to us.
It becomes increasingly challenging to keep up with this influx of data.
Most of the information available has already undergone a filter of interpretation.
However, there is also a substantial amount of free "raw" data accessible to us,
which we can interpret ourselves and form our own opinions if only we could access it.\\
**Data to See aims to gather and present these datasets in a way that allows everybody to view and form their own opinions freely.**

## Principles
- the data is not manipulated
- the data is not interpreted
- the data source is published on the page
- the data source is independent
